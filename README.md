#Support files for Huntington University CS275

## Structure
Each class has at least one lab.  The directories are named for the class number and the lab number.  The numbers are first in the files' names to make finding them easier. Example: class 1's 3rd lab is 01lesson/03lab.

## What you will find here
Starters for each lab session that you can use to get a leg up.  Starters for homework, unless you are to start from zero.

## Trying hard to keep out, but there may be exceptions
Finished homework
