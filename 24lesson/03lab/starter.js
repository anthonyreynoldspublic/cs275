  using this input material, let's rebuild class Week 12 — 12.2. We did this material earlier. Let's structure the 12.1 lesson to closures and lambda functions bc they seem to go together. We can give hints about what styles of things to test for all 75 minutes. The students have only minimal exposure to the DOM so include teaching the DOM in this lesson. it currently presumes knowledge of many capabilities that students would not yet have been exposed to. let's make this class' content from this minute-by-minute plan for my "cs275 web scripting" class . I'd like to use these books, HTML & CSS (Jon Duckett) — covers first 4–5 weeks, and JavaScript & jQuery (Jon Duckett) — carries them through the DOM and small projects. as the basis for the materials. I'd like to include test-first methods as early as possible (the students have to know something about the DOM, CSS, HTML5, JavaScript, build tools etc before they can test, I bet). I'd like to leave the students with a sense that they can use LLMs to write their code but they must be able to explain what the LLM produces so they can fix it if they must, or that they can tell the fixes the LLM proposes lead them in circles. Let's ensure it's an LLM-first course. The students will think they're going to get smart and LLM their way out of the class. Let's fix it so they get smart and can coexist/orchestrate LLM activities the class is 16 weeks long, meets on T Th for 1:15 each session, and should have two classes I can throw away just in case we get stuck on something. There are no tests. There should be 10 mini homework assignments and a final project in which the students show us something cool. Students should use Visual Studio Code on their laptops for assignments and in-class "human" efforts, and they should also have a couple of those mini homework assignments directed at running some simple web server on a raspberry pi + a webserver of your choice (nginx?). keep this 🧠 Pedagogical Core Test-first thinking = comprehension, not compliance. LLM collaboration = structured orchestration, not outsourcing. Reflection habit = awareness of quality and agency. Pi deployments anchor abstract skills in physical reality. revise the syllabus to make use of these books. 🗓 16-Week Minute-by-Minute Schedule Week 1 — How the Web Works + HTML Basics T (1.1) Intro to HTML & LLMs 0–5 Warm-up discussion: “What is a web page?” 5–20 Mini-lecture (Duckett ch 1–3): HTTP request/response. 20–35 DevTools demo + source inspection. 35–55 LLM prompt: “Write valid HTML5 page.” → critique & repair. 55–70 Manual rebuild in VS Code. 70–75 Reflection: “What did I understand that the LLM missed?” → HW #1: Personal homepage (plain HTML).
