You are my forms assistant. Produce an accessible HTML5 registration form with:
- fields: full name, email, password, password confirmation, favorite coffee (select),
  newsletter opt-in (checkbox).
- Use proper <label for>, id, and name attributes; group related fields with <fieldset>/<legend>.
- Add required where appropriate. Use input types and constraints that make sense (minlength, pattern hints).
- Add autocomplete attributes for all applicable fields.
- Include helper text via <small id="...-hint"> and associate it with aria-describedby.
- Do not include any JavaScript. No inline styles.
- Keep it minimal and valid HTML5.
